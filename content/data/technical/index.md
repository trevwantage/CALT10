## Hardware

#### CALT Weight
10kg (22 lb) including accessories

### Printer
40 column thermal dot matrix printer

### CALT Battery                         
This is a rechargeable Li-Ion battery pack consisting of 12 high capacity cells.
This battery should provide 12 hours of continuous use before re-charging, depending upon mode of use and printer duty.

### Battery Charger Unit
The standard plug-in battery charger supplied with the **CALT** is an auto-sensing power supply that can be plugged into the following power sources without the need for any manual switching or adjustment.  The same battery charger unit is supplied to all countries, but the power cord is supplied to suit the particular country.

110 Volt AC/60 Hz, 2-pin flat plug (USA)
230 Volt AC/50 Hz, 2 pin round plug (Europe)
230 Volt AC/50 Hz, 3-pin square plug (UK)

The battery charger has a nominal output voltage of 24 volts with a maximum charge rate of 1.5A.

100 Ω nominal

### Software
The software is stored on the hard drive of the CALT. The version number is displayed on the printout and screen.  Software upgrades, for example to enable a customer specific feature, can be installed by Croft.

### Password Limitation
Passwords are limited to 10 characters.

{{% alert note %}}
It is advisable to have a password set as without one unauthorised users can change the instruments setting and could also set a password stopping CALT administrators getting access to the utilities and settings.  Passwords can be recovered by contacting us - we will guide you through the process
